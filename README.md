# Heart-disease-Predtiction
first step is importing the dependencies so we have imported some libraries and functions that we need for processing so we import a numpy,pandas and we import a train_test_splitfunction and LogisticRegression and accuracy score for sklearn library and we have to downloaded the dataset from kaggle and we have loaded it to from csv file to a pandas da 71%taframe and we have seen how to print the first five rows and the last five rows in a dataframe we have checked the number of rows and columnspresent in the dataset andwe have see some information about the data type and whether there are any missing values and we have seen how we can check the number of missing values in each column and we have found some statistical methods measures of the dataset through it Describe() function then we seen how manyyou known values are there for the target 1 and target 0 and 1-->represents the person with the defective heart and 0-->represents a person with healthy heart and the splitter the features and target. here features are every column except the target and we stored all the features in the variable X and we have stored the target values in the variable Y we have printed X and Y. the we have spltted our dataset into training data and test data and then we have loaded our logisticregression model to this model variable then we have trained our logistics model using the fit() function and finally evaluate our model using this accuracy score and we have to somewhat good accuracyscore here it's almost 85% on training data and 71% on testing data and finally the impotant part is building a predictive system when we give a value to this particular input column so our model can predict the when person is heart disease or not
